# Baal ðŸ‘º

Lo, also it is the time of His rain.

Baal sets the season,

And gives forth His voice from the clouds.

He flashes lightning to the earth.

As a house of cedars let Him complete it,

Or a house of bricks let Him erect it!

Let it be told to Aliyan Baal:

'The mountains will bring Thee much silver.

The hills, the choicest of gold;

The mines will bring Thee precious stones,

And build a house of silver and gold.

A house of lapis gems!'
