Baal is a minimal yet composable DAO template continuing work from the [`Moloch`](https://github.com/MolochVentures/moloch), [`Minion`](https://github.com/raid-guild/moloch-minion) and [`Compound`](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/tree/master/contracts/Governance) frameworks to make it easier for people to combine and command crypto assets with intuitive membership games.

*Guilds, venture clubs and control panels can benefit from Baal:*
